# Sales Data Analysis Project
<br />
<strong>Overview<strong> <br />
This repository contains data and code for an ongoing sales data analysis project. The goal of this project is to extract valuable insights from the provided sales data to inform business decisions and improve overall performance.<br />
<br />
<strong>Data<strong> <br />
The dataset consists of historical sales data, including information such as product sales, timestamps, customer demographics, and transaction details. The data is stored in a CSV file named combined_sales_data.csv.<br />
<br />
<strong>Analysis<strong> <br />
<strong>Key Questions Explored:<strong><br />
1. Optimal Timing for Advertising Campaigns: Determine the best timing for advertising campaigns on a monthly basis, considering different demographics and market segments.<br />
2. Product Affinity Analysis: Identify products frequently purchased together to inform cross-selling or bundling strategies.<br />
3. Seasonal Sales Trends: Analyze seasonal patterns and trends in sales data to optimize inventory management and marketing strategies.<br />
4. Outlier Detection: Identify outliers or anomalies in sales data and explore factors contributing to these deviations from expected trends.<br />
5. Sales Prediction: Develop models to predict future sales volumes based on historical data and external factors such as economic indicators or industry trends.<br />
6. Pricing Strategy Optimization: Analyze the impact of pricing strategies on customer purchasing behavior and determine optimal pricing adjustments to maximize revenue.<br />
7. Consumer Trends Analysis: Identify emerging trends in consumer preferences or purchasing habits and recommend adaptations to product offerings or marketing strategies.<br />
<br />
<strong>Additional Questions for Future Exploration:<strong><br />
1. What is the correct time to have advertisement monthly at different times?<br />
2. What are the most sold products together?<br />
3. What are the factors influencing sales performance beyond the data currently analyzed?<br />
4. How can predictive models be refined for more accurate sales forecasting?<br />
5. How do marketing channels and geographical variations impact sales performance?<br />
<br />
<strong>Future Work<strong><br />
1. Continuously analyze additional factors influencing sales performance.<br />
2. Refine predictive models for more accurate sales forecasting.<br />
3. Adapt analysis to evolving consumer trends and market dynamics.<br />
4. Regularly update findings and recommendations based on new data and insights.<br />
